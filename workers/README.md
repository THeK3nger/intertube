These are the very messy Cloudflare Workers scripts for serving the hosted files.
I would recommend just using R2 instead of B2+Workers (did not exist at the time).

The code for the workers is originally borrowed from this: https://jross.me/free-personal-image-hosting-with-backblaze-b2-and-cloudflare-workers/
